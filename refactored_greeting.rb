# The following code could use a bit of object oriented artistry. While its a simple method and works just fine as it is, in a larger system its best to organize methods into classes/objects. Refactor the following code so that it belongs to a Person class/object. Each Person instance will have a greet method. The Person instance should be instantiated with a name so that it no longer has to be passed into each greet method call.

# Here is how the final refactored code would be used:

# joe = Person.new('Joe')
# joe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'
# joe.name          # should == 'Joe'

# TODO: This method needs to be called multiple times for the same person (my_name).
# It would be nice if we didnt have to always pass in my_name every time we needed to great someone.

# def greet(my_name, your_name)
#   "Hello #{your_name}, my name is #{my_name}"
# end

# Solution
class Person
  attr_reader  :name
  
  def initialize (my_name)
    @name = my_name
  end
  
  def greet(your_name)
    "Hello #{your_name}, my name is #{name}"
  end
end
